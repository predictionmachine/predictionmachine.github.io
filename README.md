## About Prediction Machine

Prediction Machine researches applications of large scale machine learning to
market-moving news to forecast markets. We aim to have best-in-class collection
of fresh news, and highly sample efficient extraction of signal from the data by
using disproportionately large amount of compute.

We are insatiably curious about how advances in ML, computing power and data
availability will shape the world in the years to come, and aim to be at the
forefront of these changes in the area of time series prediction. To us,
profitable trading is proof that we are on the right track, but longer term
we hope to leverage variants of the technology to benefit humanity more broadly.
